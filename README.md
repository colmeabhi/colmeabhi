i'm a grad student at san jose state university pursuing my ms in computer science while bringing 3+ years of platform engineering experience from quantiphi. i'm passionate about building scalable infrastructure, optimizing cloud systems, and making technology more efficient ⚡, with specific interests in platform engineering, devops/sre, kubernetes orchestration, infrastructure as code, and parallel programming.

what i'm currently up to:
- 🔍 actively seeking **summer 2026 internships** in platform engineering, devops, sre and general software engineering roles
- 🏆 recently won the "agents with superpowers: context engineering hackathon" (sponsored by composio & redis)
- 📚 coursework in design and analysis of algorithms (cs-255), computer communication (cs-258), cloud computing (cs-218), parallel programming (cs-259), and machine learning (cs-271)
- 🤖 currently working in domains of computer communication and parallel programming

what i was up to:
- ☁️ platform engineer @ [quantiphi](https://quantiphi.com/) - built scalable aws infrastructure for fortune 500 companies
- 🎓 gpu-accelerated computing research and cv/ml projects
- 🔧 Built the foundational platform layers powering ai/ml workloads at scale

what i've worked on in the past:
- [ai sprint planning assistant](https://github.com/colmeabhi): automated spreadsheet-to-jira workflows with rag pipeline and multi-tool orchestration (won hackathon)
- [gpu-accelerated matrix multiplication](https://github.com/colmeabhi): cuda kernel implementations achieving 60x speedup over sequential cpu
- [automated database migration platform](https://github.com/colmeabhi): self-service python cli/rest api for fivetran & snowflake provisioning with rbac
- [recruiter/judge agent](https://github.com/colmeabhi): learning agent system that evaluates resumes and improves through feedback
- [mcp wikipedia agent](https://github.com/colmeabhi): context-aware wikipedia retrieval with token optimization and caching
- [california fishing compliance app](https://github.com/colmeabhi/regulated-fish-classification-california-datasetcreator-modeltraining.git): cv system with 91% accuracy for regulated species classification
- pothole detection pipeline: pytorch-based computer vision with 89% accuracy and real-time processing
- data platform engineering: snowflake & redshift optimization, soc 2 & gdpr compliance
