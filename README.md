i'm a grad student at san jose state university pursuing my ms in computer science while bringing 3+ years of platform engineering experience from quantiphi. i'm passionate about building scalable infrastructure, optimizing cloud systems, and making technology more efficient ⚡, with specific interests in platform engineering, devops/sre, kubernetes orchestration, infrastructure as code, and ml applications in cybersecurity.

what i'm currently up to:
- 🔍 actively seeking **summer 2026 internships** in platform engineering, devops, and sre roles
- 🏆 recently won the "agents with superpowers: context engineering hackathon" (sponsored by composio & redis)
- 📚 coursework in advanced algorithms (cs-258), distributed computing (cs-218), and parallel processing (cs-259)
- 🤖 building ml projects involving temporal graph hidden markov models for supply chain attack prediction

what i was up to:
- ☁️ senior platform engineer @ [quantiphi](https://quantiphi.com/) - built scalable aws infrastructure, achieved $90k annual cost savings
- 🎓 completed california fish species classification system using cnns (91% accuracy)
- 🔧 built monitoring systems used by 20+ engineers using prometheus & grafana

what i've worked on in the past:
- [ai sprint planning assistant](https://github.com/yourusername): automated spreadsheet-to-jira workflows with context-aware ai (won hackathon)
- fish species classification: hierarchical cnn models for california fishing compliance
- supply chain attack prediction: temporal graph hmms for cybersecurity
- aws infrastructure automation: terraform pipelines, kubernetes deployments, ci/cd optimization
- data platform engineering: snowflake & redshift optimization, soc 2 & gdpr compliance
