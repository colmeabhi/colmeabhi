i'm a grad student at san jose state university pursuing my ms in computer science while bringing 3+ years of platform engineering experience from quantiphi. i'm passionate about building scalable infrastructure, optimizing cloud systems, and making technology more efficient ⚡, with specific interests in platform engineering, devops/sre, kubernetes orchestration, infrastructure as code, and parallel programming.

what i'm currently up to:
- 🔍 actively seeking **summer 2026 internships** in platform engineering, devops, and sre roles
- 🏆 recently won the "agents with superpowers: context engineering hackathon" (sponsored by composio & redis)
- 📚 coursework in design and analysis of algorithms (cs-255), computer communication (cs-258), cloud computing (cs-218), parallel programming (cs-259), and machine learning (cs-271)
- 🤖 currently working in domains of computer communication and parallel programming

what i was up to:
- ☁️ platform engineer @ [quantiphi](https://quantiphi.com/) - built scalable aws infrastructure, achieved $90k annual cost savings
- 🎓 gpu-accelerated computing research and cv/ml projects
- 🔧 built monitoring systems used by 20+ engineers using prometheus & grafana

what i've worked on in the past:
- [ai sprint planning assistant](https://github.com/colmeabhi): automated spreadsheet-to-jira workflows with context-aware ai (won hackathon)
- [gpu-accelerated matrix multiplication](https://github.com/colmeabhi): cuda kernel implementations achieving 60x speedup over cpu
- pothole detection pipeline: pytorch-based computer vision system with 89% accuracy
- automated database migration platform: python cli/rest api for fivetran & snowflake provisioning
- aws infrastructure automation: terraform pipelines, kubernetes deployments, ci/cd optimization
- data platform engineering: snowflake & redshift optimization, soc 2 & gdpr compliance
